May. 9th, PM11:59 (~2 weeks)\n","Description. \n","## 1. \n","Writing a program for calculating “fundamental matrix” from 2 images (L.jpg  & R.jpg) and estimating “projection (distance) error” of all your points. (choose your tools, ex. C++/C, python, openCV, Matlab).\n","## 2. \n","Please manually pick-up corresponding point sets by external software (ex.   Photoshop, xnView), and import (or copy & paste) the coordinate values into your source code. You don’t need to write user-interface programs for picking up coordinate. However, you need to select at least 8 point-sets in both images, and calculate “fundamental matrix F” by any method in lecture. You also can use equivalent functions in OpenCV. Note: make sure the F has only rank-2.\n","## 3. \n","After you find out F, please generate “epipolar lines” and estimate “projection (distance) error” for every point. For example: generate “epipolar lines” (ex. Fx in right image), and calculate the “distance” between the estimated epipolar line and its corresponding point.\n","## 4. \n","Please Print Out “F” and “distance value” (point to epipolar line) in your program.  \n","## 5.

Please zip all your files, and upload to moodle by date due.  \n","### Hint:\n","I will provide Golden Answer (without error) for you, however, your result should have calculation (as well as measurement) error.\n","\n","//This is the golden answer for your reference.
